# Job Search Motivation
## Why do you want to find a job?
- To get out of this place, to have nothing to do with the family any more, with ammi or deelia
- if I get a stable place I can distance myself from them, cut away completely from them and their beliefs and their politics
- I don't need to contribute anything to their existence, I can leave them to the dust
- If they treat me in ways I don't like I can simply block them, I will go back to never calling them immediately, I won't let Deelia in
- right now I'm actually stuck, I want to be unstuck

- I want to live in a studio apartment by myself
- I want control over my environment and to the best degree how I use my time
- assuming I'm not stuck and I can have a stable part-time job, my motivation to change the world can be channeled into finding a job
