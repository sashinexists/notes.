I'm thinking about the structure of these notes.

I'm thinking of having a meta folder, it makes sense to me, it will have templates in it

I need to think of a way to use templates too.

I will want daily notes.

I will want a navigation note

you can't embed notes in the same way, way unfortunately

but teleporting is pretty easy

do you want a glossary

another probably big problem is that you can't view images
