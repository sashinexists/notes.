# 1. The Linux Foundation
There are broadly speaking three main families of Linux Distributions.
1. Red Hat based: Including CentOs and Fedora
2. Suse based: Including OpenSuse and SLES
3. Debian based: Including Ubuntu and Linux Mint

## The Red Hat Family
- Fedora is used as a testing bed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
- CentOS is a close clone of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- Uses the RPM based DNF package manager

## The Suse Family
- Suse Linux Enterprise Serve (SLES) and OpenSuse have a similar relationship as RHEL and Fedora
- SLES is widely used in retail and other sectors
- Uses the RPM based zypper package manager
- Includes YAST (Yet another setup tool) for sysadmin purposes

## The Debian Family
- Significantly bigger repository of software than either the Red Hat or the Suse families
- A pure open source project with no ties to any corporation
- A focus on stability
- Uses the DPKG-based APT package manager
