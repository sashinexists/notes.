# The Dawn of Everything
In public discourse, there are two main points of views of the broad sweep of human history.
- One from Jean-Jacques Rousseau who argued that humans in the state of nature were innocent, they lived in small tribes and that our troubles began with the advent of agriculture when our existence became tied to the tending of a number of staple crops. This led to the onset of private property and created a surplus which was able to support an aristocracy in turn leading to the formation of civilisation and the state. From the Rousseauan point of view all the bad things that we see in society today came through this sequence of events.
- The other view is that of Thomas Hobbes, who wrote The Leviathan. From his perspective human nature is intrinsically violent and the instituions such as government are essential to keeping people in awe, too afraid to give in to their baser instincts.
These views of the stages of history from bands of hunter gatherers to the state, have long been widely rejected in the fields of Archaeology and Anthropology as evidence has long been building up of a much more colourful picture of ancient politics. 
- However this undestanding has been slow to permeate into popular discourse, with even popular non-fiction authors writing confidently as if human history played out in either of these two ways.
- (Steven Pinker for example is a modern Hobbesian while Yuval Noah Harari is more of a Rousseauan)


## Scratch
I've been reading this book for months.
I've started again almost twice.
It talks about the origins of political inequality and the many possibilities for human civilisation.
It refutes the ideas that hierachies are inevitable when society becomes large or complex enough.
It refutes the ideas that either farming or large cities are points of human development that inevitably lead to the existence of social classes and hierarchy.
There are many examples it provides of human societies that break almost every set of expectations that we could have.
