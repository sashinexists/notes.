# How do we know how old archaelogical findings are?
How is that we can date antiquities and artifacts to such a high level of precision?

There are a number of ways:
- Radioactive materials decay into more stable isotopes at a uniform rate, they have predictable half lives. It is possible to date artifacts with precision by looking at the radio of unstable isotopes of certain elements including Carbon and Potassium.
  - [[zettelkasten/carbon_14_dating]]
- Trees reliably grow a new layer of bark every year, it's possible to count the number of rings inside a tree trunk to date it accurately, this can also be done with fossilised trees
  - this is called dendochronology
- stalagmites and stalactites form in predicable ways
- Rock formations form in predicately ways, with sediments layers over one another over time
  - stratigraphy: the study of layers of earth
- There are probably other ways of dating, and if writing existed at the time, then it can be deciphered as well (it may be dated explicitly or reference events contemporary to the time)
- These different methods of dating can check one another, if we date objects in different ways and they align, we can have high confidence in our estimates
