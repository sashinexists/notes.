- Let's think through this game theory stuff
- you have Population, organism

const CHANCE_OF_MISTAKE:f32 = 0.01;
const GROWTH_FACTOR: u32 = 2;
const DEATH_FACTOR: u32 = 2;

struct Ecosystem {
  community: Vec<Population>
}

struct Population {
  size: u32,
  species: Organism
}

struct Organism {
  strategy
}

impl Organism {
  fn strategy(&self, game:Game) -> Bool 
}
