- Things you want to do
  - look into the thermostat, how can you turn it on only for upstairs or only for bedrooms
- put in your calendar the 7th of april for a change in your sleep, actually the 6th as you'll be going to bed then
- actually you want to change to sleeping closer to eight and waking up at five
  - might be a tad rushy if you sleep until five
  - maybe think of a morning routine to make things happen smoothly
    - jpdb, anki, clothes, exercise, walk, breakfast, shower, read/meditate/podcast/cards2/start
- I think you should exercise more frequently, every morning
- when you wake up at night and don't think you can get back to sleep walk it out, don't force it
- You want more stability and assurance from life
- "client mind", when you become super sensitive to things taking time when you are in front of someone
