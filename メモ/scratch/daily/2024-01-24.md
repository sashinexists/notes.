- (5:47午後) Work is good, I'm enjoying working through this ticket, maybe I can be done tomorrow morning



## Thinking through work
- (10:31午前) first you want to think through the model and the different cases
  - starting with everything closed
- (11:16午前) let's think about what commands you'll need
  - get all category names
  - get all products in a category (categoryView)
  - get all treatmentAreas in a product

- on initialise you get all category names
- when you click on an accordionHeader you do the other things
- you don't need the treatmentaccessdata if it's just a product that is open


Let's think about how you name the routes
- get all category names
- get all product names in a category
- get all treatment areas in a product


you actually need to get all treatment areas and which ones are checked
- like an outer join between the tables then


- (12:54午後) the toggle accordion section needs to handle every case and send the right message
- (5:02午後) you are up to the view
