### Videos I think you should watch: Modern Monetary Theory

My main mission now is to get more people to understand how the world works.  

An understanding of how the world works, makes one immune to propaganda.

One piece of propaganda is that the government runs "on tax payer's money".

This is strictly speaking untrue.

When the government approves a budget, it is sent to the federal reserve who mints the money into existence.

This doesn't involve physically printing the money but rather increasing numbers on a computer. 

They government then spends the money in to the economy, it goes towards all they government initiatives and projects, to the employees being paid those initiatives, to whatever they spend money on and so on so forth it begins to circulate through the economy.

The relationship between the increased money in the circulation and inflation is complicated and it's simply not true that it reliably leads to inflation. 

What exactly is government spending money on? 

If it decides to buy up most of the carrots in the economy, then carrots and anything that uses carrots in them will increase in price.
