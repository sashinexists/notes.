- (4:09午前) Good morning
  - I feel like the conversation that I'm having with Avani is really important, you should send a voice message
- (4:34午前) You really should look into saving money on the websites you've got, if you can get a ghost instance working on vultr that would be good
- (5:05午前) Another personal project should be learning to edit wikipedia articles
- (5:25午前) you want to do autogenerated maps for this, maybe you should think this through, you will definitely be using bash to achieve this
  - should it be `+<foldername>`
- (5:42午前) I was fighting with myself last night when waking up during sleep, should I stay in bed or get out of it?
  - If I felt like I could go back to sleep it would make sense to stay
  - If I didn't then I really should "walk it out" -> this way I keep the mental association between where I sleep with sleep
  - but sometimes I really don't know, I don't know if I'm on the verge of sleep or not
- (6:04午前) I'm going to take a break from flashcards and drink tea
  - today you have an APA meeting, it's a little exiting, you'll see Toni for the second time and you'll meet with Corey Condon
  - maybe there will be other people
  - should be very possible to leave a good impression, and maybe learn a little more about how the business works
- (11:29午前) my new awareness of cause and effect is stressing me out a bit
- (6:01午後) Just aliases cat to bat, this is going to be great
 

### How the script will work
- Looks in the root folder
  - makes a map file names it +foldername
  - in that file it creates a link to every single file in that folder
  - and a link to a map in every folder in it
  - it then goes into every subfolder recursively and does the same
- maybe you can do this after you have a shower and get chatgpt to help you
- this should be done in a new script which is added to notes autostart
