- buy that bamboo neck pillow from tk max or maybe online
- think about your sleep

- you wanna buy that document thing from daiso too
- it's $472 for an annual pass to blacktown leisure centre, let's think about how much you'd need to go to make that worth it
  - if you want the steam room and sauna as well it's $798
  - it's $15.30 for adult entry
  - you would have to go twice a week for it to be really worth it
- tree pose yoga is $50/week
- snap beaumont hills is $25 a week
- you want to find a way to save money on your website hosting

## Short-term money plan
- continue to budget as normal
- wait until you have six months worth
- then start increasing your spending allowances starting with moving out, followed by soulara
- aim to keep a month's worth of expenses less than one paycheck if possible (maybe be very difficult)
- Ammi wants to increase your weekly rent by $50, this puts you $200 back on your plan per month, or $1200 over six
  - (2024/01/30 10:26午前) silly you are forgetting that some months have five sundays


## Things you need to do regularly
- clean the bathroom
- clean the toilet (already on top of this)
- clean your room (already on top of this)
- clean the fridge
- clean the microwave
- every now and again you need to wash and switch your quilts, same with you pillow case
