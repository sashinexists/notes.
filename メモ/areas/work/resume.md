## Summary

I am a writer and software developer who wants to leave the world better than I found it. My ideal job, at least in the short term, is a comfortable, secure role in software development that is part-time, allowing me to spend the remainder of my time on reading and writing. I love Rust and am open to learning other technologies for monetary needs.
