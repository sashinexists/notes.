Okay, for this ticket you want to add a table to review prescriptions that shows a list of all the BMIs of the current patient
- I guess you can start with figuring out where all the data is
- there's not much data, you'll have to create it
- going to make a patient-bmi route
- relevant files
  - `DoctorsPortal.elm`
  - `patient_bmi.py`
