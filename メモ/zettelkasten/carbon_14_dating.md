# Carbon 14 Dating
## (2024/03/31 6:57午前)
A note on the below, apparently carbon-14 decays back into Nitrogen-14 and not into Carbon-12, that's what it is saying in a correction on the video, Khan made a mistake

## Notes
- You just watched this video on Khan Academy

## Free notes
- Carbon-14 is formed when cosmic rays from the sun (which are really particles - I'm assuming photons) collide with Nitrogen in the atmosphere.
  - This is happening all the time
  - The cosmic "ray" displaces a proton in the Nitrogen atom and becomes a neutron
  - The number of protons is what determines what an element is, so with one less proton, the nitrogen becomes Carbon-14
    - as the number of neutrons is not the same as the number of protons, this is an unstable isotope that gradually decomposes to Carbon-12
    - (2024/03/31 6:58午前) Apparently it decay back to Nitrogen-14 and not into Carbon-12
    - (you should look up why it's the case that isotopes where the number of neutrons and protons are different are unstable)
- Alternate isotopes can react in the same way and form the same compounds
- So a carbon-14 atom can operate in the same way as a typical carbon-12 atom
- We are made from carbon, and some of this is carbon-14
- We intake the carbon when we breath it through the air as well as we eat it in our food, some of it is carbon-14
- We only take in carbon from the environment while we are alive, any carbon found in a corpse must have existed when that person was alive
- unstable isotopes reliably decay at a uniform rate, in the case of Carbon-14 decaying to Carbon-12 it takes around 5730 years for half the carbon-14 in a sample to decay into carbon-12
  - that is; the half life
- therefore, in an ancient corpse, or fossil of a living creature, we can look at the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-14 to calculate its age to a fairly high level of precision
- Carbon-14 dating is only useful for dating up to around fifty to sixty thousand years ago
