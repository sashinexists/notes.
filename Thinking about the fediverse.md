# Thinking about the fediverse
Currently watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrNE2fSCeFo).

I think I want to get Lemmy as well as Mastodon, so I have twitter and reddit.

Lemmy doesn't feel too good.

I wonder if instances work like communities, also,  

The next things to get would be FediFacebook and FediLinkedIn.
