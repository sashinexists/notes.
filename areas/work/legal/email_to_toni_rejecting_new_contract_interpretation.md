Hi Toni,

I've looked at the pay and reread the contract.

I disagree with your interpretation.

In the interview I had with you and Ben earlier this year, I definitely meant 80K for three days a week.

I remember carefully considering how much I'd need in advance, and I went in the interview intending to ask for that amount.

I read the contract carefully to make sure that it was the right amount.

It was 80K, no 89K, and it was not FTE.

There's no part that suggests that this number is FTE or anything other than for the 3 days of work.
