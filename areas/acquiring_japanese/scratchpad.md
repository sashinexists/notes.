- right now you want to go through dogen's pronunciation course and you want to go through all the words in aomi


(2024/05/08 8:34午前)
- After learning all the words of persona 3, move on to orange days

(2024/05/01 4:52午前)
- I think you should go through all of 青春豚 and make sure you understand *everything* you can consult miho sensei about everything
- after that you should listen to the entirety of trees of happiness and maybe the mouse story on satori reader, I think it's cool to do it on the laptop
  - after this you can finish beyond the storm and even buy true colours before switching to playing through persona 4


(2024/04/05 5:37午前)
- Okay, after you finish anohana, the next big thing you'll do is go through the persona 4 deck
  - you'll finish this by the end of winter and be in a very good position ot play the game



(2024/01/26 2:39午前)
- Okay, you're learning ten words a day, you'll be starting anohana next month as well as another code
- you are almost up to date with nihongo con teppei for beginners
- you want to read more satori too
- there's also pitch accent, it's probably the most urgent thing to learn but you are really stuck
  - kotu
  - migaku (should you start a habit?)
  - Yusuke's channel

(2024/01/29 4:19午前)
- Genius idea, watching educational videos (science, history, etc) that are aimed at children
  - I want to watch lots of these, maybe find a decent channel
- (4:47午前) It can be a little painful going through the cards sometimes
- (5:27午前) It's probably a good idea to do kotu today
