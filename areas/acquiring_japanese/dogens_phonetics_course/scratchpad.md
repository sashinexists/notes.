- The japanese vowels are not identical to the english ones and you should probably practice them
- devoicing is a thing, う and い between two unvoiced sounds, or just at the end after an unvoiced sound like です is unvoiced, the voice is not voiced (your vocal chords don't move)
- the 'n' in な,ぬ,ね,の is very similar to the english 'n' but with the tongue slightly more forward (touching the teeth)
