- The japanese vowels are not identical to the english ones and you should probably practice them
- devoicing is a thing, う and い between two unvoiced sounds, or just at the end after an unvoiced sound like です is unvoiced, the voice is not voiced (your vocal chords don't move)
- the 'n' in な,ぬ,ね,の is very similar to the english 'n' but with the tongue slightly more forward (touching the teeth)
  - the hatsuon can be articulated in many different ways
- し is completely different to the english "shi", for one the lips are completely neutral, and secondly the tongue position is different, the tip is on the bottom teeth and the tongue reaches toward the roof of the mouth
- what was palatization again?
  - it's when a voice following a consonant changes the initial position of the tongue to the palate
  - かけこく all block hair at the back of the mouth, but き the tongue blocks hair in the middle of the mouth
- this is lessons 33 - 57, meaning there are 24 videos of pronunciation
- じ seems to have two pronunciations depending on whether it is the first mora of a word. If it is then it's an affricate (dz) if not then it's just the voiced し (a fricative)
  - it's only a fricative (or the voiced し) after vowels
- something similar is with z, at the beginning of a word it's an affricate (dza) and after vowels it's just a voiced s
  - after the small っ (促音) it's an affricate
