- Heiban words do *not* have a downstep
- Atamadaka, Nakadaka and Odaka *do* have a downstep

- Downstep: Atamadaka, Nakadaka and Odaka
- No Downstep: Heiban

- だ (casual form of です) connects just like a particle
  - attaches low to downstep words
  - attaches high to heiban

- です
  - For downstep patterns, both mora of です attach low
  - For heiban, there is a drop in です
    - that is the で attaches high while the す attaches low

- みたい follows the same rules as です
  - For downstep patterns, all mora attach low
  - For heiban, it attaches high and there is a drop
    - that is the み attaches high and the たい is low

- だろう
  - For downstep patterns all mora attach low
  - for heiban, it attaches high and there is a drop
    - that is the だろ is high and the う is low


- でしょう follows the same pitch accent pattern as だろう
  - For downstep patterns, all mora attach low
  - For heiban, it attaches high and there is a drop
    - that is the でしょ attaches high and the う is low


- らしい (meaning, "I heard that" and not "seems like") also follows the same pitch accent pattern as だろう
  - For downstep patterns, all mora attach low
  - For heiban, it attaches high and there is a drop
    - that is the らし attaches high and the い is low

- らしい meaning "seems like" follows a different set of pitch accent rules to the above
  - when attached to a downstep form, the noun it is attached to become heiban and stays high until い
  - with heiban nouns it works identical to the above

- There are two kinds of i-adjectives, downstep i-adjectives and heiban i-adjectives, each of which follow different pitch accent rules

- In downstep i-adjectvies, in the dictionary form (辞書系) the downstep occurs in the second last mora
  - Examples
    - よい : HL
    - うまい : LHL
    - おもしろい : LHHHL

- A major exception is 多い(おおい)
  - おおい : HLL

- There are two ways that these downstep i-adjectives conjugate
  - the traditional way
  - the new way

- in the traditional way the downstep occurs *one mora early*
  - うまい : LHL
  - うまく : HLL
  - うまくて : HLLL
  - うまかった : HLLLL
  - うまければ　: HLLLL
  - うまがったら : HLLLLL
  - うもさ : HLL 

If the downstep i-adjective only has two mora, then the downstep cannot be shifted one mora early
  - よい : HL
  - よく : HL
  - よかった : HLLL
  - よければ : HLLL

- in the newer way, the downstep does *not* shift
  - うまい : LHL
  - うまく : LHL
  - うまくて : LHLL
  - うまかった : LHLLL
  - うまければ　: LHLLL
  - うまがったら : LHLLLL

For the さ form of 3-mora downstep adjectives, only the traditional pronunciations are used

Dogen finds it difficult to recommend the newer or the traditional pronunciations.

He recommends that we learn both and actively listen for them, and "let the chips fall as the may".

- Dogen highly recommends that japanese learners go with the nakadaka pronunciations of 赤い and 冷たい and heiban i-adjectives in general
