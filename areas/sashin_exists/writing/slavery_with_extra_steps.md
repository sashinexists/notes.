# Slavery with Extra Steps

You are a slave.

The food you eat is grown, processes and distributed by slaves.

The building you live in was built and is bein maintained by slaves.

The clothes that you wear where made by slaves.

What kind of slave? A wage slave.

Why do I feel justified in this?

Because what happens when you stop working?

You lose your income.

If you lose your income, you will eventually lose access to all that is needed to sustain life. A roof over your head, and a reliable stream of food, water, clothing and medicine.

In the end, you work, or you die.
