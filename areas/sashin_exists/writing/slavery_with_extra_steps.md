# Slavery with Extra Steps

You are a slave.

The food you eat is grown, processed and distributed by slaves.

The building you live in was built and is being maintained by slaves.

The clothes that you wear where made by slaves.

What kind of slave? A wage slave.

Why do I feel justified in this?

Because what happens when you stop working?

You lose your income.

If you lose your income, you will eventually lose access to all that is needed to sustain life. A roof over your head, and a reliable stream of food, water, clothing and medicine.

In the end, you work, or you die.

If we were living in a state of nature, this would be at least a little more reasonable.

The food needs to be found, or grown. The water needs to be carried. Houses need to be built and maintained. Clothes need to be made.

But we're not.

The work you perform to meet your needs very likely has absolutely nothing to do with actually meeting those needs.

This is not good.

One person's bread shouldn't be dependent on another person's pleasure, covenience or even self-actualisation.

Your life, or anyone else's life for that matter, shouldn't depend on labour that does anything except sustain our lives.

When one person's desires and whims determine another person's needs, we have slavery.

We humans should collectively work together to meet our collective needs.

This is not what we are doing.

We are wasting the bulk of our lives in our nine-to-fives, and if we are being honest with ourselves, not achieving very much.

The title of this piece "Slavery with extra steps", is something I first heard in an early episode of Rick and Morty. 

> "It's society, they work for each other, they pay each other, they buy houses, they get married and make children that replace them when they get too old"

> "That just sounds like slavery with extra steps."

What are the extra steps?

The extra steps are bureacracy and complexity. 

The extra steps increase the complexity of the system so that the injustice is obscured.

At best these work to get the slaves to enthusiastically accept their condition, but more realistically it gets them to begrudgingly accept them as if a law of nature, something that "just is" rather than something that needs to continually manufactured over and over.
