# How the world works
We live in a class society. The two classes that walk this earth are none other than the two referred to by Karl Marx an Friedrich Engels.

- The Bourgeious, or capitalist, who own and control the means of production.
- The Proletariat, or the workers, who are forced to sell their own capacity to labour to them in order to make ends meet.

Most of us are in the latter. We spend most of our waking lives in the factories, farms, offices and institutions of the capitalist.

What we do for a living, what we pour our existence into until the day we retire, is effectively making making said capitalists more money.

In exchange, we get a small amount of what we make them, which we are able to live off of.

Without this we are not able to make ends meet, we are not able to put food on our plates, pay our rents or mortgages, or survive medical emergencies.

Therefore, the capitalist has a lot of leverage over the worker, losing your job means risking your life as you know it.

Unemployment, hunger and homelessness work beautifully for the capitalist.

They are the perpetual threat that is held over the worker and those suffering these fates, out on the streets, serve as reminders of that threat.

More importantly if there is an excess of hungry, desperate, unemployed individuals vying for jobs, it makes the worker replacable.

The capitalist can rest at ease, in paying their workers as little as they can get away with and forcing in them to work in terrible conditions. They know that if they push too hard for a better deal, they can simply be replaced. 

The money that would go into better pay, working conditions and benefits is the same money that would be otherwise be realised as profit.

The interests of these two classes are diametrically opposed. The instability of the working person, is the very leverage of the wealthy. 

It is important that you know that society is divided between classes, between two groups of people whose interests are in violent opposition.

Understanding this sets the groundwork for understanding why the world is the way it is. The game of politics that has been playing long before any of us were born can be seen through clearly and many mysteries about the world unraveled. It is possible to gain an understanding for how the world works and why things are the way they are, and to no longer be the kind of person that is continually shocked by the news cycle -- and to instead say "of course".

### The times we're living in
Living is getting expensive. Haven't you noticed?

Once upon a time, after a few years of work, an ordinary person could buy a home outright.

These days, it takes immense time and energy, for a rather extraordinary person to afford to be able loan for one.

// the nature of the relationship between capitalists and workers -> hungry desperate workers is *better* for the capitalist
// if the cost of living is low, capitalists lose real power
// give the story about how land was artificially made more expensive in america for the benefit of the capitalist

// After all this you can actually explain what is capitalism, what is capital, how it works, the falling rate of profit, maybe even the labour theory of value, how it leads to the end of itself and go into how socialism is the alternative
// you can explain what socialism is, how it is *not* social democracy along with what the problem with social democracy is
// talk about the actual conditions of the USSR, Cuba and China and what a human achievement they are in how they did not require exploitation
// it's happened before
// the essence of socialism is that things are done directly for the social good rather than for private profit
