### Hello everyone,
I hope you are all well. That's the goal by the way, a world where we are all well.

In this piece I want to discuss the terms "left" and "right" in politics. 

What do they really mean? When did they originate? How do they differ across history and around the world?

In my 2019 piece [Insert Label Here](), I argued that the terms were used in such a myriad of ways that there were basically nebulous.

I argued that since the terms "left" and "right" seemed to point to these different bundles of views that didn't seem to do much with one another, that the terms were meaningless and we would be better off without them.

I no longer believe this.

There are good reasons why we put some ideas on the right and others on the left, and these reasons hold true across time and over borders.

### What are left and right?
We refer to the right as being "conservatives" and the left as being "progressives", but what exactly is it that they are conserving or progressing towards?

> What the right conserves is the status quo, and more specifically *the hierarchies within it*

> What the left progresses towards is an egalitarian world, the left aims to dismantle hierachies

This is what otherwise very seemingly different things such as religion, capitalism, the monarchy, traditional gender roles, nationalism and white supremacy have in common.

All of these are ways to consolidate the existing power structures in society.

When the right disagrees, it is in how these hierarchies should work, which ones are the most important and who should be on top.

- Those in favour of capitalism at least implicitly believe that those with more wealth and resources should be at the top (and if there is no social security net, they also believe they should be able to hold the threat of homelessness and starvation over those without)
- Monarchists believe that a Monarch and their family should rule and that this power is bestowed by divine right and passes on through that monarch's bloodline. They believe that there should be an aristocracy of nobility consisting of families that are connected with the King's that should rule above the greater population who live as peasants
- Theocrats tend to believe that religious leaders should administer governance, a class of religious clergy ruling on behalf of everyone else.
- Fascists 
- Libertarians
