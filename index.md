Good morning!!!

Should you like do the daily notes thing, now?

you should watch the video on advanced helix.

### scripts you want
- the datestamp, date time
- a daily note (in a scratch folder?)
- maybe it should automatically open in the daily note
- it should check if that note exists or not and open it if it does

basically you need to write scripts for these and put them in a menu

timestamp and datestmap have been done!!!
proof: (8:59午前)(2023/10/07 9:00午前)

next up, do you want to write in a daily note

how does that work, this place is messy, maybe you should use headings more liberally


having eureka point here is probably a good idea

- okay, this morning you will start with
1. jpdb
2. tricky helix
3. also watch the fediverse video
4. see if you can get ghost working in docker and nextcloud working in docker
5. writing

Hello Sashin, I hope you are doing well.
hello there


These are your notes.

You have to figure out a way to get the most out of this.

You want to write about socialism among other things.

## Concurrent programming in Rust
- this is a youtube video that was recommended by the gpt-4 online course
 [Rust: Shared-State Concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGjuAFxvXnU)
- Mutex is short for "Mutual Exclusion"
- It means that only one thread can gain access to the data at a time
- A thread gains access to the data by acquiring a lock


this document is wild you just right anything, anywhere

You had this idea of learning being a web, when things link together you get better gains


just riffing

- we're born into a world that already works in some way
- we are compelled to follow its rules
- where did they come from?
- we are living organisms we need food and water and shelter
- how can we get these things?


socialism 101 is probably the best place

- climate change
- poverty
- housing crisis
- inflation
- having to work everyday
- unemployment rate

We're born into a world that was already running. 

## Let's think of some scripts you could write to create
- you could do a daily note script
- you should definitely do a date script

- now I want to learn about the fediverse, maybe you can get some social accounts happening

something's not right, I keep getting a block around socialism

socialism is just running the means of production directly 

it's building and running hospitals for the sick
it's running schools to educate
it's running farms to feed people

rather than having this infrastructure owned privately by entities that run them for their own profit.


okay, now you're on mastodon

you need to find friends on mastodon

You should do a list of youtube videos
- creator
- topic
- title
- link
- notes


you should write a list of things that existed back then
- free education
- affordable housing
- look at America and Australia some time ago
- look at sweden and the nordic states back then and now
- look and neoliberal ideology and the imf
  - brazen lies mentioned in soft currency economics
  - you can mention "the real economic"
  - austerity is nonsense + you can add class to it

I can focus on the lie!!!!

objectivity about standards of living, free education existed!!!! free medicare existed!!!

We live in a class society. The two classes that walk this earth are none other than the two referred to by Karl Marx an Friedrich Engels.

- The Bourgeious, or capitalist, who own and control the means of production for their own profit.
- The Proletariout, or the workers, who are forced to sell their own capacity to labour to make ends meet.

Most of us are in the latter. We spend most of our waking lives in the factories, farms, offices and institutions of the capitalist.

What we do for a living, what we pour our existence into until the day we retire, is effectively making making said capitalist more money.

In exchange, we get a small amount of what we make them, which we are able to live off of.

Without this we are not able to make ends meet, we are not able to put food on our plates, pay our rents or mortgages, or survive medical emergencies.

## Let's think through all the areas you have in life right now, let's simplify things
### Acquiring Japanese
This feels really stable at the moment, you have something going on, you are really feeling the gains over time
- daily jpdb
- listening
- novel / new anime and content (occasional)
### Politics/economics/understanding how the world works
- Modern monetary theory
- socialism/communism
- Relevant channels
  - 1Dime
  - First Thought
  - Hakim
  - Marxism today
  - Oversimplified
  - RealLifeLore (not socialist but useful for geopolitics)
  - Second Thought
  - The New F Word (by second thought and others)
  - Yugopnik
  - Two specific videos by Bill Wurtz
    - history of the entire world, I guess
    - history of japan, I guess
- topics
  - unequal exchange: neo imperialism and the IMF and World bank
    - [Hakim's video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjLmYCfKU7o)
    - this ties in with mmt and austerity policies
- What is communism?
  - it's when the means of production is communally run and owned
- What is socialism
  - it's when the means of production is run and owned by the worker
  - it means we're doing things directly and not for the profit motive
  - it means the means of production are not privately owned and run for profit
- What was capital again, I think capital was something?
  - I had in my head capital was wealth that was invested to create more wealth
  - maybe you should crack open socialism utopian and scientific
- I think that it would be good to make it more relatable, to the fact that people have to go to work and pay rent, when they pay rent, they are not paying for the maintenance cost nor the fixed cost
- market price is just how much can be milked
- the market is not efficient at allocating resources, this is utter nonsense
- I think I want to write a piece on the labour theory of value

- What 
### Getting a job/skilling up
- 20 jobs a month
- you also have to talk to that woman at the place, this could eventually be a problem
- you should also look on ethical jobs and maybe seriously apply
- chatgpt course
- data structures and algorithms course
- Linux sys admin certification
  - [course link](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/linux-system-administration-essentials-lfs207/)
### Sashin Exists
- writing a piece on socialism
  - Think about the why behind the piece
  - What does the normal person know about what socialism is and what capitalism is
- writing a piece on modern monetary theory
- my mission is to make the workings of the political and economic world legible to all
- you want to make friends that are keen to read your work
### Life Maintenance

Daily notes would be great, so would a single daily note
