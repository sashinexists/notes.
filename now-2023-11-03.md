## What I'm doing now
## Still Acquiring Japanese
I've now been studying Japanese for the last three years.

For the first two years I was still finding my feet, having tried countless apps, websites and methods.

About one year ago I found a fairly stable consistent way of learning that works for me.

It has two parts:
- Learning new vocabulary and consolidating existing vocabulary with jpdb.io
- Immersing in japanese content, actively by watching anime and playing games in japanese and passively by listening to audio

I use the website jpdb.io which allows you to learn new flashcards with their SRS system.

SRS stands for Spaced Repitition System.

The way it works is you have flashcards with the vocabulary you are learning on the front and the defintion on the back.

![[front]]

![[back]]

You are presented with the front of the card and attempt to recall what the word means, then you check the back of the card to see if you were right. 

If you get the card wrong, you will see the card again in a few minutes. If you get it right, then the interval until you see the card again increases.

For example:
  - If you see a word that you know, and mark it as correct, you won't see it for a day 
  - When you see that card a day later and mark it correct, you won't see it for another two days
  - When you see it again and mark it as correct, you won't see it for another four days
  - Four days later when you see it again and mark it correct, you won't see it for a week

Every time you mark a card right, the interval until the next time you see the card increases. The idea is that the best time to reinforce something in memory is right before you would have forgotten it. Furthermore it means that most of your time will be spend on revising what you've been forgetting.

The website jpdb.io also has built-in decks that can be used to source vocabulary.

The above is the deck for the anime Tsuki ga Kirei ("The Moon is Beautiful"). Adding this deck to my list means that I will learn every single word in all eleven episodes of the anime series, ten words per day.

I found the anime by doing a search through their database of built-in decks. I searched with two filters; a difficulty of 2/10 or less and a rating of 8/10 or more - so the search would show only series that were both very easy and highly acclaimed.
