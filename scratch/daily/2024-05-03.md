- (4:03午前) Pretty sure my oura is running out of juice in the course of a single night
- (4:32午前) two tech problems, one is that I can't see my infinitime and the other is that the oura ring doesn't seem to be connecting
- (4:59午前) I don't feel like doing the flashcards or even learning japanese this morning
  - on the contrary apparently I want to implement event sourcing
