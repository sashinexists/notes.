- (4:03午前) Pretty sure my oura is running out of juice in the course of a single night
- (4:32午前) two tech problems, one is that I can't see my infinitime and the other is that the oura ring doesn't seem to be connecting
- (4:59午前) I don't feel like doing the flashcards or even learning japanese this morning
  - on the contrary apparently I want to implement event sourcing
- (5:06午前) to tell what people really care about, pay attention to what they actively bring up, not just what they agree to when brought up
  - what are they actually fighting for, what are they pushing against, what rings their alarm bells, where is their energy going
- (5:25午前) I'm so mad that my oura ring isn't working!!! I want to be able to improve my sleep, I feel unsatisfied in the mornings not knowing
- (5:41午前) things on my mind; politics and the different kinds of socialism, event sourcing for work, learning japanese
- (5:44午前) maybe you can read a little about archaeology before work
  - you also want to have breakfast
  - and take your medicine
- (7:14午前) you should check your todo more often
- (7:30午前) it might be good to work through nativshark
  - (7:34午前) it does seem like it might be epic, 166 exercises in phase one
    - about 40 a day for the next few days to finish phase one
- (7:42午前) I think it would be better to work through satori, definitely if the input hypothesis is right
