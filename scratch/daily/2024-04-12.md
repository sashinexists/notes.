- (5:07午前) now you are feeling that you should do some more dogen
  - (5:07午前) I feel the creative energy

## thoughts

Bad epistemology is like a security vulnerability in the mind.

You can only act as well as you know.

If you don't have a good way of distinguishing what's true or not, then bad ideas can enter the mind.

Other people will be able to convince of things that are:

1. Not true
2. Lead you to behave in ways that are against yours or others interest
3. Lead you to behave in ways that are in *their interest*

It can be like a backdoor.
