- (4:46午前) I don't have the same energy I had yesterday evening, I'm less buzzy about making 
- (4:58午前) at work you should aim to swiftly finish off with the date component and move on to what you really should be doing
- (5:07午前) now you are feeling that you should do some more dogen
  - (5:07午前) I feel the creative energy
