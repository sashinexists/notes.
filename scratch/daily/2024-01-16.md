- (6:31午前) Good morning!
- I still want to learn how computers work
  - a part of this is how clocks work, and how the clocks inside computers work - this is important
    - you just watched a branch education video about this
    - you want to know more about electrical engineering in general -> but maybe focus on history now

## Interests
- History, Economics, Politics (how does the world work, how can we make it better?)
  - Infrastructure -> you want to read the book you have on this
- How do computers work? The hardware. You might want to play Turing Complete again, or do those courses on Electrical Engineering on Udemy
- How Linux Works, you should finish the LFS207 course and finish the book how linux works
  - would be good to get more specifics on gnome, fedora and silverblue as you may be married to your current system
- Learning Japanese
