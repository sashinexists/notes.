- (5:49午前) Good morning!
- (5:49午前) You need to do morning things!
  - Let's see how much of this linux course you'll do before you get started with your morning things
  - It might also be a good idea to get some exercise, to go on a run
- (5:54午前)  
- (4:11午後) Okay, now you are learning about system processes, learned about load averages
- (7:10午後) Today was productive even though you didn't get through six modules, tomorrow, you will set up the infrastructure for your savings account
- (7:11午後) and you can get that sweet sweet compound interest, it'll be so sweet, compound interest, it will be sweeter than sweet potato
  - (7:12午後) You won't really think about it and it will be nice, you will slowly start to build out some security and be more disaster prone
- (7:13午後) This linux course and the knowledge that you gain from it will ultimately be more fruitful I believe
