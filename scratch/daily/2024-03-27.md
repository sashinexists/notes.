- (5:10午前) show Christin the part of the Dawn of Everything that talks about consciousness
- (5:10午前) you actually have work in three hours!!!
- (5:37午前) maybe you should be gradually trying to write something before you start going to the meet up again
- (5:46午前) stop using workforce Australia, it's arguably dangerous
- (5:47午前) I wanna do some form of japanese study after the flashcards, maybe kotu and super native
- (6:18午前) I think looking at questions is really good when taking notes
- (7:30午前) tempted to get a mastodon thing at library love
- (7:31午前) you need to look into getting a ghost server on vultr again, also look into getting a mastodon server
  - (7:31午前) when you upgrade to v3 of taskwarrior it'll be much safer to mess with vultr, it may have been dogmatic to get Fedora Core OS
- (10:05午前) am a little tired now, going to eat
- (5:31午後) should be fine with the current ticket, maybe you'll even finish tomorrow





Thinking about the Dawn of Everything
- all of Eurasia as well as (I think) africa was more or less connected as a whole world system, ideas travelled across the continents influencing one another
- however before the spanish started colonising the Americas they were largely intact
  - they were a completely different world system
  - Neil Degrasse Tyson said something like biologists can't make generalisations for what life is like as we only have a sample size of 1 (life as it evolved on planet earth), for all we know it could have happened in many different other ways
- The same is largely true for culture and politics, as we only have one world population... except this wasn't always the case, there was an entire other world system in the Americas that was developing parallel to the Eurasian world system with no contact or influence
- If there are any universals to the way human cultures are societies are structured then they should at least arise both in the americas and in Eurasia
  - (as ideas travel effectively through Eurasia and they have since the stone age, it's difficult to say that things "independently arise" there, eg; it's hard to say monarchies arose independently or if they were copying each other)
- Chapter 11 of the dawn of everything goes through the history of the americas, particularly the east coat between around 200BC and 1400AD (this is from my memory)
