- (9:36午前) thinking I'll watch bocchi the rock and the bakemonogatari
- (9:52午前) there's like a big war in my mind about whether to spend my time reading Dawn of everything or studying Japanese in some capacity
- (9:52午前) I think I'll eat and play another code for now before reading
- (1:09午後) That didn't happen, I really want to do both and maybe it's making me do neither
  - let's try reading more
- (3:17午後) should I do free recal exercises?
  - (3:17午後) I should definitely listen to somethings in japanese while doing kitchen stuff
- (3:58午後) you got distracted
- (4:01午後) okay go "have dinner" and come back
  - tomorrow you should make stir fry
- (4:02午後) you need to get a present for shaili
- (4:36午後) I think tomorrow you should go through all the chapters so far!
- (4:38午後) I feel a kind of tiredness, a kind of exhaustion from this book at the moment
- (5:01午後) I wonder what warrants a permanent note
- (5:03午後) you need to read some wikipedia articles
- (5:37午後) maybe you could watch this playthrough of the witcher III

### The Dawn of Everything Free Recall Session (3:54午後)
- You started reading this book because you wanted a better understanding of human history
- Why is the world the way it is?
- Why are the power structures the way they are?
- how did the state come into being?
- What are some of the different ways that humans have organised? Particularly without hierarchies
- Thinking through the book now... Lahont, I can't remember if Lahont was the westener that met Kandiaronk or a name that he gave Kandiaronk
  - Kandiaronk was a Wendat statesman if I remember correctly
- the wendat were really great orators and they lived in towns and organised in a confedrations across northern america (I believe modern day Canada and the US)
  - they were great orators because they got a lot of reps in their town planning
- there were two visions for how society developed one by Jean Jacques Rousseau and one by Thomas Hobbes
  - I think Hobbes can after Rousseau, he was english and was living in the times post or during revolution when things were getting chaotic
  - he believed that people were better to one another when they were living in awe of an authority (which he believed should be a monarch)
  - he looked at how monarch's themselves were the only people that weren't and they always seemed to fight one another
- I believe that both explicitly said that they were conjecturing when talking about the history of the human race
- Rousseau conjectured an innocent state of nature where people lived in small egalitarian bands, this maps on somewhat the the marxist idea of a primitive communism
- He submitted a piece to two different essay contests, the first he won, in the second he was disqualified for going over the word limit
- Steven Pinker is a modern Hobbesian
- It's possible that Yuval Noah Harari is a modern Rousseau person
- he also looked at how Yuval compared indiginous tribes to apes rather than humans
- there's also Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs and steel" which was mentioned
  - I can't rememeber the exact critique that wengrow and graeber had of it
- what else is there about the book
- let's see there is the missionary that was actually an atheist that got a glimpse of honesty from the native americans and became friends with them
- there are the jesuits who were disgusted by them, specifically their freedom
  - it's amazing how the right wing has changed so much in form but so little in substance
    - freedom was explicitly bad according to the jesuits
- let's think Cattalhyuk, Gobekli Tepe (potbelly hill)
  - both existed in what is modern Turkey
  - I'm not sure if the same time though
  - Cattalhoyuk is the one with the wall paintings and cube buildings that you enter from the roof, there were no windows or doors or streets (they hadn't been invented yet)
    - apparently was a matriarchy, only figurines of older women
    - they contrasted a lot with contemporary groups which were likely patriarchies and likely formed through schismogenesis
