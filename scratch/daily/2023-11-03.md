## What I'm doing now
### Still Acquiring Japanese
I've now been studying Japanese for the last three years.

For the first two years I was still finding my feet, having tried countless apps, websites and methods.

These included:
#### WaniKani

#### Samu School Lessons

#### 

### Linux System Administrator Certification
