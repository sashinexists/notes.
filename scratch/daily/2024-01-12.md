- (4:26午前) Good morning, it feels like your hands are a little higher than yesterday, I wonder if this will make things harder or not
- (4:27午前) I don't know if it's actually harder or if I'm simply not used to it
- (4:29午前) On the employment side, I'm waiting for them to ask for bank details after that I want to know when I get paid and I'll be waiting for that, I also want to know what I get paid in a two week period
  - (4:30午前) They also need to ask about my super
  - (4:39午前) It looks like CrueltyFreeSuper is still goated


## Things to bring up to Ben
- in my understanding, following the spec will be impractical, especially on a tablet
- bring in the suggestion of using an accordion
- ask for permissions to bring in elm-ui and create reusable components in it, you can do it in a components.elm
  - you can slowly over time, create and use these componets as you do tickets and eventually replace the html code


## Thinking about work
- I'm going to build a components.elm and build a component library
- first step is to import elm-ui
- okay, now you want to make an accordion, you need to make a header and content for the according
  - the header will just be text and the content will be a list of elements



## work status (2024/01/12 7:03午後)
- I think you can have a function that looks like this
  - (AccordionSectionModel -> msg )
  and have it passed in that function
