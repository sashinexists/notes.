- (6:04午前) you should create a mutual aid budget
- (5:00午後) feeling good about work, should be possible to replace everything from the SelectPrescriptionItems.elm
  - then work towards inlining the component
  - then work on the aesthetic changes to that component
  - then the rest of the changes


## the following is copied and pasted from yesterday's scratch (you can make permanotes from them)

- (5:26午前) how do I make these cards easier on myself?
- (7:10午前) vowels are made by moving the vocal chords
- (7:20午前) うand えsounds in japanese (including in くけすせぬね etc) will always become devoiced when in between two consonants
  - unvoiced consonants in japanese are K S T CH P
- (7:28午前) with s, it's a continuous sound because air is passing through, even though the vocal chords aren't doing anything
  - this happens with devoicing, air passes through the same pattern that would otherwise have voice
- (7:43午前) one of the reasons (possibly the main reason) why words have different valid pitch accent patterns is because of the effect of devoicing on pitch accent
