- (4:50午前) Good morning!
- (4:59午前) You want to slowly watch through the next episode of tsuki ga kirei, you can probabaly rewatch some others later today
- (4:59午前) Would be pretty sick to watch through a few episodes of the script building list
- (6:19午前) I feel like I could go for rewatching a bunch of episodes slowly and parsing it sentence for sentence
  - Maybe at a future time all these cards will be more stable
- (6:39午前) I'm feeling good, I might want to think about my notes again
- (6:40午前) Think about how you could have a structure that would let you glide through notes
- (8:18午前) With this new media player you should definitely watch a whole lot of anime
- (3:45午後) Okay, you want to think a little more about how you want to do notes, maybe you should have it open straight into the daily note
