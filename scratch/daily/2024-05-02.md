- (4:07午前) Good morning, let's hope you can see your sleep data today
- (4:23午前) I don't think there is anything special you need to do this morning, you can just go on a walk and listen to tokyo sonata
  - I think it would be a good thing to do both supernative and migaku this morning
    - hell maybe even some satori!!!
- (4:57午前) the most time consuming thing that you need to do this morning is the application of the medicine
- (7:07午前) you should find a way to exit helix from insert mode
- (4:09午後) you can have a lot more nice things in insert mode
