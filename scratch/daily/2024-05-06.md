- (4:15午前) good morning
  - do the morning flashcards, then meditate, then maybe do a notewriting session, then seishun buta yarou
  - I'm kind of unsatisfied with my japanese progress now, I believe I need to continue to staunchly focus on listening
- (4:18午前) if you watch all seishun buta yarou today then tomorrow you can listen to it, maybe while cleaning
- (5:04午前) I want to gain the legitimate, justified confidence to just read japanese
- (6:32午前) gonna have two breakfasts today, porridge and then nutrigrain
- (6:33午前) maybe get some sight words for roshi
- (8:01午前) your attention is drifting to other things, try meditation if it keeps
- (1:48午後) at this point it's *not* about learning words (but continue doing that anyway)
- (5:41午後) tomorrow go over the second episode of seishun buta yarou
- (7:16午後) it's weird how much energy I have now
  - you definitely should go over everything in satori, it's so high quality
- (7:16午後) you need to think about how best to manage your energy, moving out will be really good for this
