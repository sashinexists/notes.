- (4:07午前) you have some energy to read the archaeology book this morning, which I find interesting
- (4:08午前) first read one piece
- (4:53午前) would it be better to not post chats early morning
- (5:53午前) tell Ben about codon
- (8:08午前) maybe work on a gnome shell extension to get your desired behaviour
- (6:12午後) you really ought to watch the alt-right playbook again
- (6:32午後) on your budget you should be specific
  - it's $9.35 a month to support him
  - think about this tomorrow



## the following is copied and pasted from thursdays's scratch (you can make permanotes from them)

- (5:26午前) how do I make these cards easier on myself?
- (7:10午前) vowels are made by moving the vocal chords
- (7:20午前) うand えsounds in japanese (including in くけすせぬね etc) will always become devoiced when in between two consonants
  - unvoiced consonants in japanese are K S T CH P
- (7:28午前) with s, it's a continuous sound because air is passing through, even though the vocal chords aren't doing anything
  - this happens with devoicing, air passes through the same pattern that would otherwise have voice
- (7:43午前) one of the reasons (possibly the main reason) why words have different valid pitch accent patterns is because of the effect of devoicing on pitch accent
