- (4:19午前) Good morning!
  - I wonder if you should do a bit of meditation
    - I think I will maybe even before breakfast
- (4:35午前) since I fell asleep at 8 I'm confident I didn't sleep enough
  - I hope I'm feeling better by work
  - maybe need somet caffeine?
- (4:42午前) after this month it should be easier to jump into writing
- (4:44午前) the residue from three years ago is a battle with myself, I've already escaped them
- (4:59午前) I really need to make some friends bad, I have a feeling Alex's wedding won't be a good place for this
- (5:26午前) how do I make these cards easier on myself?
- (7:10午前) vowels are made by moving the vocal chords
- (7:20午前) うand えsounds in japanese (including in くけすせぬね etc) will always become devoiced when in between two consonants
  - unvoiced consonants in japanese are K S T CH P
- (7:28午前) with s, it's a continuous sound because air is passing through, even though the vocal chords aren't doing anything
  - this happens with devoicing, air passes through the same pattern that would otherwise have voice
- (7:43午前) one of the reasons (possibly the main reason) why words have different valid pitch accent patterns is because of the effect of devoicing on pitch accent
- (7:50午前) let's listen to tokyo sonata while working
- (8:14午前) there's something amazing to that devoicing lesson, it's like I can relisten to things and find novelty
