- (7:39午前) testing!!! will this remain??
  - (7:40午前) it seems to be working, the daily files are in the right place AND it seems to persist
- (7:40午前) all thanks to absolute file paths in the linked files
- (7:42午前) I can actually write notes and plan things now!!
  - (7:42午前) the only thing is that the today and yesterday symlinks will only work on this computer, if you sync it, since they are absolute not relative
