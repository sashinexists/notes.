- (3:55午前) I would love to read the wikipedia article for language acquisition this morning
  - also have to do flashcards
  - and wash clothes 
- (5:10午前) repetition seems to make things boring
- (7:24午前) flashcards at the moment use an enormous amount of time and energy
- (7:51午前) upgraded gnome everything feels fine, the top bar isn't working so it's a little hard to tell the time
  - you should see if you can get a shortcut to open the calendar from the top bar
- (7:53午前) slack seems to have broken
  - you should get on fixing that, look at the .desktop file and all of that
