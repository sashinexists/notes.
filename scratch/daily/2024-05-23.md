- (4:04午前) Good morning
- (4:18午前) the oni shadowning series seems really, would be good to pay for it later too (after finishing and maybe even recording all the free ones)
- (4:20午前) I should record myself saying a lot of words with し,じ,ち, ひ and see how I sound
- (4:26午前) maybe start with watching everything in Dogen's pitch accent course, at least the first part (as well as doing the tests) and after that think carefully
- (4:32午前) I feel like the way that I naturally do し is definitely wrong
- (4:33午前) this is seriously bothering me
  - (5:00午前) maybe I need to get more sensitive to what my mouth is doing with し
- (5:12午前) maybe going through aomi will help
