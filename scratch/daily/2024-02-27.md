- (4:56午前) I have a lot of confidence that I could go out with Akane for some reason
  - It could be misplaced
- (5:06午前) I didn't give consent for this interest to bloom in me, it may die in the future
  - (2024/02/28 5:06午前) Update from the next day: it feels like it's died
- (6:13午前) I feel a little happy about all of this, it's like something is unblocked
- (6:13午前) I wanna start doing my notes today, what is an insight? Should you watch a talk?
- (6:18午前) Adding Archeology a very short introduction to your reading list, maybe it goes well with the dawn of everything
- (6:42午前) you want to buy "the cell" very short introductions
- (7:50午前) there is a funny feeling in my head when I'm reading, I think I don't want to start this book now, I want to continue with the Dawn of Everything
- (7:51午前) let's make yesterday a thing, a script that works
  - let's first look at the workspace config and after that at the script that opens your notes
- (11:30午前) You will have topics, resources, research questions and related
- (11:43午前) maybe you can have autogenerated maps, or an autogenerated map
  - you would want to write a script that made a +main.md document with a list of every file and every folder (the folders link to the main files in those folders)
- (11:46午前) would be sick to have an easy way to (from within helix)
  - convert a note to pdf
  - do the above and open it immediately
