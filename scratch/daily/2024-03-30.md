- (5:33午前) the fact that you have to leave at some point is so fucking disruptive
- (5:37午前) it might be worth it today finishing the n3 on bunpro
- (5:41午前) I feel really bad reading japanese out loud, I'm not confident at all and I'm fearful that I'm getting reps pronouncing things wrong and solidifying bad habits
- (5:44午前) I do feel like I ought to expose myself to all the grammar including the N2 and N1 grammar explicitly, very likely probably multiple times in different contexts (eg; in Bunpo and in Nihongo no mori)
- (5:48午前) so many things you want to do that having nothing to do with chopping those vegetables
- (5:55午前) maybe you should spend the next two days binging through anime, specifically 月がきれい and 青春豚野郎
- (6:19午前) oh no, I have developed the habit of second guessing myself, I need to increase my confidence
- (7:56午前) would be wonderful to look into some kanji mnemonics
- (9:56午前) maybe you should make a database for it and generate them, you should generate some
  - (9:57午前) maybe a database of vocab, kanji and radicals
- (5:03午後) you should go through all of your voice messages
- (6:03午後) maybe do a few of Dogen's videos, or at least work slowly from the beginning, after which you should get a phonetics lesson
