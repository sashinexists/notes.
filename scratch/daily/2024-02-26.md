- (4:36午前) Good morning!
- today I wanna watch anohana and figure out how I ought to go to the dentist
- (2024/02/26 12:57午後) I need to incorporate wikipedia with the rest of my learning and reading!
- (2:55午後) Ask Ben if he's ever contributed to open source
- (5:14午後) Think about how you want to take notes and have a zettelkastl
  - maybe a zettelkastel folder 
  - maybe just atomic notes in the zettelkasten folder, this feels ideal, you can have topic notes, research questions and resource notes to link to
  - oh that feels nice
  - I could have a script that goes through the atomic notes in order to generate the topic notes, research questions and resource notes
- (5:33午後) tomorrow you will go through the first half of the book and start implementing them
- (5:42午後) it would be epic if i could create a yesterday shortcut just like the today shortcut
- (5:52午後) I do think the ideal would be the kindle would automatically generate the resources
- (6:06午後) maybe you can tackle a few things at once tomorrow
  - skim through all of the book so far and take notes -> insight notes that might become atomic notes
  - seek additional context on each tribe mentioned, maybe some of the scholars, as well as each ancient site
    - even some of the geography would be good, like look up the location of certain rivers mentioned
  - you could start editing relevant wikipedia articles, read relevant wikipedia articles and edit them with added sources
- (6:08午後) figure out how to do yesterday here, I guess first you have to look at how today works
  - maybe when today is defined yesterday can be set to the previous today
- (6:20午後) I feel happy today, life is good
- (6:20午後) there's also typing, that's a whole thing, consciously typing is probably the way to get better





 


Thinking of changing sashinexists to writing, and actually expanding sashinexists.com to multiple websites each with different goals
