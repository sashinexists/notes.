Hmm... if you're habitualised to putting effort into something, it *feels* like you aren't putting any effort at all... therefore it becomes hard to release that effort because it's hidden in the familiar

I think when learning anything, one of the most important things you can do is get good feedback loops and I think this means trying to get an understanding of "what's right and why" and mapping this onto your internal sense of is right and wrong.

In language learning communities online, there's this recommendation of having a "silent period" where you only input the language, for some months to a year. The reason is because if you say things wrong, or make mistakes in pronunciation, before you have a sense of what the language actually sounds like, you won't know to correct and it may even "feel right". Worse still, you'd get repetitions of pronouncing things the wrong way which may be difficult to change later on.
