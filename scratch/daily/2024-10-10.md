- (4:52午前) Good morning!
  - gotta wash your hair this morning
  - hopefully after breakfast
- (5:23午前) let's put the air thing on high and later you can put the breathe easy on
- (6:16午前) put your clothes away
- (3:55午後) lie database (idea) -> snopes is quite similar
- (4:29午後) watch a psychology of political cults
- (8:24午後) yugioh is so good, loved the new ost that came when marik's alter ego was unleashed
  - I wonder how it would have gone if rishido didn't faint
  - I'm guessing either falling asleep doesn't cause it, or he only sleeps while marik is sleeping
- (8:26午後) been feeling some chest pain, I blame is on the pringles
  - gotta find some better snacks
    - fruits are probably the way to go here
- (8:26午後) would be epic to wake up to one piece
  - (8:26午後) would be nice to fill your bottles and empty your flashcards before sleeping, also change into pyjamas and brush your teeth and stuff
    - (8:27午後) maybe even a bit of meditation
- (8:28午後) just need to make it until the end of the month to have both a new phone and the steam deck
