- (4:33午前) Good morning
- (4:51午前) Simple productivity system https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7vM5wEUz_s 
  - Inverted pyramid 3 2 1, spend 3 hours on the most important thing, then 2 hours on the second and then one hour on the last (you can work out the tasks on the go)
  - take breaks as often as you need (when your brain is tired) but exercise intensively in them
  - create a distraction free environment if possible
- (10:13午前) okay


free recall on awk
- Awk is a text manipulation programming language, it's really old and the initials come from the names of the three authors
- it is turing complete
- basic way it works is that you have a pattern and an action, the program walks through a text file line by line, checks if the line matches the pattern and if it does it performs the action
- the pattern can involve regex
- the awk command basically takes in a whole awk script
- like this
  ```bash
    awk -f script.awk textfile.txt
  ```
- that f above specifies that it for a file
- awk scripts tend to be really short and written inline
  - like this
    ```bash
      awk '{print $0}' textfile.txt
    ```
  - The part in single quotes there is the contents of the script
  - this script will simply print every line of the file
   - the default variable $0 refers to the whole line here
- $1 , $2, $3, etc refer to fields or columns
