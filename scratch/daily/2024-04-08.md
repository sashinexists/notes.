- (3:50午前) Good morning
  - a bit of a crisis of wanting to do lots of different things (and being forced to prioritise)
  - writing a "what I am doing now will help"
  - I have a feeling that starting the podcast Blowback would be great
- (3:57午前) what I do may need to connect more directly to the burning questions on my mind, I should consciously think of them
- (4:01午前) there's also the fact that you haven't fully opened your hips yet
- (4:04午前) you'll go on a long walk today, maybe end up at hungry jacks
- (4:10午前) I feel I should almost certainly by life is strange 1 and play it
  - well the remastered collection, and you can play both sequentially and slowly
- (8:20午前) What should you write about?
