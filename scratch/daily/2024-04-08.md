- (3:50午前) Good morning
  - a bit of a crisis of wanting to do lots of different things (and being forced to prioritise)
  - writing a "what I am doing now will help"
  - I have a feeling that starting the podcast Blowback would be great
- (3:57午前) what I do may need to connect more directly to the burning questions on my mind, I should consciously think of them
- (4:01午前) there's also the fact that you haven't fully opened your hips yet
- (4:04午前) you'll go on a long walk today, maybe end up at hungry jacks
- (4:10午前) I feel I should almost certainly by life is strange 1 and play it
  - well the remastered collection, and you can play both sequentially and slowly
- (8:20午前) What should you write about?
- (3:25午後) plan is to finish your flashcards and then clean the kitchen, probably while listening to something
  - you could listen to dawn of everything or something japanese
  - maybe the last episode of anohana again
- (3:37午後) I should make vegan shepherd's pie
- (3:47午後) what am I doing now?
  - Still Acquiring Japanese
  - Learning about history, economics and politics (talk about the book list and youtube channels)
- (4:21午後) I like the format of having the name of the piece right off the bat
- (4:22午後) you could write a piece like that
- (5:25午後) I'm writing pieces in my head kind of effortlessly
