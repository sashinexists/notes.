- (4:52午前) I generally don't like Shaili's friends at all and I don't want to have to hang out with them
  - I want to leave this family, I want the relevance of all of these people to be lost
  - I hate living here
    - options: Riley's place or a studio
    - you should talk to Riley and Corey about their place and about not owning a bed
- (7:51午前) maybe make an email folder called slack later
- (1:12午後) I think maybe what I need to do is, make this work with the database, I also want to enforce order
- (2:46午後) now you want the checkboxes to actually work with the database, I think the way I would best do this is with an upsert 
- (3:49午後) so I need to add to the upsert AND insert to the events table
  - (3:49午後) this makes sense
