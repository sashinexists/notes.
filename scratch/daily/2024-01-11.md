# 11th 1月, 2024
- (6:08午前) Work feels really good so far, this feels stable, like something I can keep doing and hold
  - (6:09午前) would be good to make friends with everyone and to develop a deeper knowledge of the whole stack, how the app is built and the periphery technologies used like Azure, as well as about how the agile and sprints work
- (6:09午後) Today was great


## to ask ben
- ssh?
- ticket

## Commands that you need
environment variables
- export DATABASE_URL="apa-db.postgres.database.azure.com" DATABASE_NAME="postgres" DATABASE_USER="apadev" DATABASE_PASSWORD="P9aC4GMehxZ3vpc" BASE_URL="https://portal-allurepacificaesthetics.azurewebsites.net/"
for the python backend with the database
- flask run 
for the vite elm frontend
- npm run dev
getting the frontend to use the wix context
- wixSite


## thinking out loud about work
- I want to make it so that the list of patients displays
- maybe put something saying the number of patients in the code
- (1:45午後) all treatment names
- (2:07午後) group entries
- (2:14午後) get Ben to walk me how the product dropdown works
  - (2:59午後) maybe this isn't necessary any more
- (2:25午後) The data that you need is a list of every single product


## concerns about the ticket
- It will be really long, a lot of scrolling, possibly not good for the tablet
