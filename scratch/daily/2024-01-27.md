- (4:24午前) Good morning!
- (5:17午前) I think I should do something towards Acquiring Japanese today, the no brainer would be to spend time on kotu and maybe to immerse
  - Aomi is a good option too
  - Maybe ゆうだい先生's youtube channel would be a good place to go too
- (5:42午前) I'm interested in learning how to host my own matrix server as well as my own mastodon server
- (8:01午前) I want to gain more tech independence
- (8:40午前) Things I am interesting in doing: running a single-user mastodon instance, getting my own matrix server (this is encouraged by matrix) and seeing if I can contribute to an open source project - Silverblue
- (10:24午前) just switched to K9 for android, I am excited for them releasing thunderbird and I am also excited for the linux smartphone ecosystem getting better
- (11:49午前) you should remember that areas is a thing that exists in taskwarrior
- (1:34午後) What would I WANT on my cloud
  - nextcloud
  - taskd
  - ghost for sashinexists and conversation culture
  - mastodon instance
  - matrix instance
  - mail server with mailgun capacities
- (4:09午後) Thinking about your preferred terminal config, you like
  - zsh
  - ohmyzsh
  - a bunch of scripts
  - taskwarrior
  - dotfiles
  - hx
    - the thing that lets you edit the command in helix
    - relevant language servers would be nice
  - things to program, rust cargo npm node all that jazz
  - a postgres program would be good too
