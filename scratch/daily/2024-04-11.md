- (4:15午前) there's something that I wanted to do that I forgot
- (4:29午前) you should honestly just start working through the linux system admin stuff now
- (4:46午前) you should really remember disk usage
- (4:54午前) history flipped inside out
- (5:11午前) yeah you should work through the linux course
- (5:15午前) listen to that molly white podcast
- (5:34午前) you might want to learn about the DOM to do this
- (5:39午前) I think you are going to make a rust crate that models the DOM and generates valid xhtml
- (6:06午前) better offline has had so many ads, wild
- (6:26午前) I want to spend some time learning to edit wikipedia
- (6:45午前) thinking about reputation, the twofold problem
- (6:54午前) I think there might be a lot of value in the politics of wikipedia, how does it work?


### ideas that you had today
- Get back into the LFS Linux Essentials Course
- Learn to edit wikipedia
- Learn about what wikipedia's secret sauce is, why is it so trustworthy? Can we build similar structures elsewhere?
  - and why is it so resistant to the influence of capitalists
  - I find it super interesting that assume good intent is one of the pillars
  - You should look into the conflict resolution process, maybe there's something you can learn about the politics of wikipedia
- you want to create a library in rust for representing xhtml, you want to follow every rule so you can only create valid structures

### About me
I don't really know how to identify people.

What is a person?

What pieces of information are important?

This is hard, so I'll go randomly.

I'm learning Japanese so that I can read One Piece, my goal is to be fluent and able to read comfortably by the time the last chapter of One Piece is released.
