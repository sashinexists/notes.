- (4:47午前) Good morning!
- (5:36午前) oh yeah you were going to make stir fry today
  - (5:36午前) more obsessed with the notes though for today
- (5:54午前) short walk this morning and a note taking session and then make the stir fry while listening to witcher gameplay
- (10:06午前) what is the right amount of times to tangent in a piece, somethings it can be fun and even satisfying to tangent a few times and come back
- (10:58午前) What would I want to tell friends about?
  - what do I want to remember
  - What answers my burning questions about the way the world works
  - what's relevant to what I'm reading next
- (11:34午前) I'm building conventions and patterns of behaviour even now
- (12:00午後) this isn't working reading about pygmies isn't doing it
- (12:35午後) I want to be able to talk with more confidence about how the world works
- (12:35午後) I still don't have a decent theory on how to take notes
- (12:37午後) I want to use this precious time as well as I can
- (4:55午後) I feel like I'm entering my second another code arc, I hope I can balance it with read the Dawn of Everything
  - maybe you can rewatch all of Bunny girl senpai
- (4:58午後) thinking about energy and hype, what it means to have energy to do things
- (5:16午後) I just remembered that the switch is portable and I could be playing Another code in my room
- (5:46午後) It was fun playing a bit more of that game, what was it called again, Life is Strange
  - this time I'm going to do the fun route

- what's a pygmy
- what's a kalahari bushman
