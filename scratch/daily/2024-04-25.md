### The Relation between Wealth and Poverty
Wealth is created through poverty. There's no such thing as money. 

What we call money are just numbers on a screen, or bits of paper or metal.

We have a system that having these tokens, we can command labour.

This labour is what wealth is really made from.

Why do people work for money?

Simple, they don't have a choice.

If they don't they won't be able to buy food, water, shelter and the necessities.
