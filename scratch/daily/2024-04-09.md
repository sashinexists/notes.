### Now

### Working Part-Time as a web developer
I feel like I've given up on a career that changes the world.

A career is a way of earning money, which means you need to ultimately serve the interests of those that have money.

- having to go to work
- not having guaranteed food, water and shelter
- not being able to simply find some land and growing stuff
- not being able to look after ourselves directly
