- (6:02午前) you want to make dahl curry and golden curry
- (6:11午前) practicing phrases on migaku is what you have to do
  - I guess you are at an annoying bottle neck in japanese
    - to break it you want to be able to listen to at least slice of life more or less perfectly
    - also you want to be able to hear pitch accent clearly (finish migaku, maybe even get all the achievements)
      - well make it so migaku and kotu are both close to effortless
  - after this you could look to seeing Natsumi sensei as well as to do shadowing
  - you need to go through episodes 4 and 5 of orange days too
  - let's prioritise migaku on saturday over going over those two episodes
- (1:12午後) looks like the steam deck is coming to australia officially next month
