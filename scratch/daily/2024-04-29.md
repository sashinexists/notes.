- (4:39午前) buy this in two days time (wednesday morning) https://www.amazon.com.au/gp/cart/view.html?ref_=nav_cart
- (4:41午前) I feel the urge to listen to Japanese while doing my flashcards
  - I need to actively listen more while I do them
- (4:46午前) I'm going to get this headache sorted
- (3:00午後) okay finish these flashcards and then read the instructions on your medicine and get all of that sorted
- (5:07午後) okay tonight
  - you want to do the vicks thing and you want to put the cream on one last time before sleeping
- (5:25午後) work through installing calyxOS on your phone tomorrow


## thinking about tomorrow
- you will get paid most likely, and you will be budgeting that you can think about your financial situation
- it would be pretty sick to install calyx on your phone
- you want to take your medication properly, the antibiotics right after your flashcards
- both the steam thing and the cream on face 3 times a day
- would be really sick to install calyx on your phone by following the instructions carefully
