  - (5:10午後)
  - Pitch accent four patterns, atamadaka, nakadaka, odaka, heiban
  - the pitch of the first two mora are always different
    - for heiban it goes up and stays up,
    - for atamadaka it goes down and stays down,
    - for odaka it goes up and only goes down after on the particle
    - for nakadaka it goes up and goes down before the last mora
  - right now you are going through all the words in 青春豚野郎 up to episode four
  - you never got good at recognising kanji and rather you've been learning as a side effect of learning words
  - maybe you should write down words as you learn them, this will be valuable even starting from now
    - you can even learn the kanji at the same time this way
- with grammar you are taking screenshots and going through them with Miho sensei
- you also have your desktop background being screenshots with the sentences
- I can't wait until I have less difficulty in following slice of life, it may be earliest february
- the plan is to finish 青春ブタ野郎 and then 日所 and then the highschool boys version of nichijou, after that it might even make sense to dive into full metal alchemist or kino's journey
- this will take a few months to finish, you really do need your patience for this, to do the new words kanji properly you'll need your phone with you too
- it would be cool to start to associate kanji with meanings and it would make your flashcards smoother and faster
- but first priority is getting more familiar with the spoken language, much more familiar
