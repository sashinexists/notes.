- Let's think through things
- you want a way of backing this vault up, I wonder if nextcloud is the best way
- okay you want nextcloud + github + possibly something else
  - you can get rid of your obsidian sync now
- I wonder if you could move your infrastructure over

## Rust Microbit programming terminology
### Peripheral Access Crate (PAC)
- Provides a safe interface to interface directly with the peripherals on a chip

### Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
- build on top of the PAC
- Provides an abstraction that is actually useful to someone that doesn't know about all the special behaviour of the chip
- usually abstracts whole peripherals away into structs


### Board Support Crate (BSP)
- abstracts away a whole board at once


### "embedded-hal"
- "The idea behind embedded-hal is to provide a set of traits that describe behaviour which is usually shared across all implementations of a specific peripheral in all the HALs"

## thinking about these notes and syncing
- you definitely want syncing to happen
- github, nextcloud -> enough?
- you also want it syncing effectively between your phone and laptop
- I think when you turn on your laptop you want something that saves whenever it noticed a change in the folder
- (this is a change to test the script)
