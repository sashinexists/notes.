- (3:36午前) bad sleep it seems
  - would be good to exercise this morning, go on a run, then have a shower where you wash your hair
- (4:14午前) conversations in japanese seem more useful than one person talking
- (4:36午前) the monster in you that demands novelty!!!
- (4:37午前) there's still the linux course (maybe sunday??)
- (6:00午後) after japanese class you can checkout the community gardens and makybe walk around balls head
- (6:11午後) okay you're going to watch through all the new zelda in japanese, it's decided
- (6:13午後) in a way, giving people your attention, your energy, gives them power
  - if there are a legitmate (read: physical) threat then you should do so anyway, perhaps without signalling it to them
